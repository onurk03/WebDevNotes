# WebDevNotes
A mix of my notes and practice implementations while learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

--> Learning.html is a webpage where I take notes using HTML and also practice some of its concepts while learning it.

--> UWClone.html is a clone of University of Wisconsin's login page I created with HTML/CSS.
